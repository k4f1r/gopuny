### Convert multiple Emojis to Punycode simultaneously
###### I wanted a quick way to convert emojis to `punycode`. The other repos here were mainly libraries, albeit much more advanced. 

* This uses the preferred idna-uts46-hx standard
* Imports `golang.org/x/net/idna`
* Suitable for Namebase.io


#### Simply replace the emojis in `main.go`. Use regex to add commas/spaces in a text editor.
